# yesCode-Forkify

The Forkify Recipe app is an interactive web app that interacts with the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) to fetch and display recipe food data. The app allows users to search for recipes, view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need. 

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

Run webpack in development mode:
> `npm run dev`

Run webpack in production mode:
> `npm run build`

Run:
> `npm start`
